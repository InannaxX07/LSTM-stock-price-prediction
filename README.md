# LSTM-stock-price-prediction

This project demonstrates several advanced concepts and techniques:

Time Series Forecasting: The project focuses on predicting stock prices, a common application in finance and algorithmic trading.

Deep Learning with LSTM: It uses LSTM neural networks, which are particularly effective for sequence prediction problems like time series forecasting.

Prophet: Integrating Facebook's Prophet library showcases your ability to work with state-of-the-art forecasting tools.

Ensemble Methods: By combining predictions from LSTM and Prophet, the project demonstrates your understanding of ensemble techniques to improve model performance.

Data Preprocessing: The code includes data preparation steps for both LSTM and Prophet, showing your ability to handle data for different model architectures.

Model Evaluation: It calculates and compares performance metrics (MSE and MAE) for individual models and the ensemble.

Visualization: The project includes a visualization of the predictions, which is crucial for communicating results to stakeholders.

Use of Popular Libraries: The code utilizes widely-used libraries like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, which are essential in many AI roles.


To run this project, you'll need to install the required libraries: "pip install numpy pandas yfinance scikit-learn tensorflow prophet matplotlib"
